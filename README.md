# Simple Job Application


## Introduction

This project is a simple job application written in HTMl. As someone who is just embarking on my journey into programming
in HTML, I created this prokect as a simple learning exercise. It's designed to be straightforward asking user for personal 
information such as full name, email address, address, telephone and resume. The user has the ability to upload and attach 
resume and then submit when done.

## Learning Journey

This project is a testament to the initial steps of my programming journey, emphasizing the use of fundamental HTML skills
such as forms. As such, it's crafted with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for other beginners who might
be interested in exploring basic form projects in HTML.

## How to use

To play the game, you will be prompted to enter a lower and an upper bound for the number range. The game will then calculate the
number of guesses you have based on these bounds. Your goal is to guess the correct number within these attempts. After each guess,
the game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct. If you run out of number of guesses and still did not guess
the corrent number, the game will tell you that you have run out of guesses amd give you the correct number.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. This game is compatible with Python 3.x. Here are the steps to get the game up
and running:

1. **Install Python:** Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Download the Game:** Clone this repository or download the game file to your local machine.
3. **Run the Game:** Navigate to the game's directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the command `python3 game_filename.py
4. ` (replace `game_filename.py` with the actual file name).
